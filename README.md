# Bruno`s Projects
## https://brunodpl.github.io/Data-Analytics/
### I am a Data Analyst in continuous development, and a future Data Scientist, passionate about problem-solving and efficiency.
### I am fully bilingual thanks to having lived in places like Texas and Reykjavík.
### I have a technical background in web application development, which provided me with skills that are now deeply ingrained.
### I have worked in both technical environments and high-paced operations; a clear example is my role as a Manager at Domino's Pizza in Iceland, where I led and managed the store completely—from implementing my own initiatives in logistics optimization and cost reduction, to recruiting new team members and managing each of the roles carried out.
